### Prologue ###
About 20 years ago in the City of `<name:city1>`, king `<name:king1>` was the respected and beloved ruler. His queen finally gave birth to the son he had longed for. Great sorcerers of the country came to infuse the child with powers only wieldable by the king's bloodline. The high cardinal of the great cathedral came and gave an enchanted pendant to the child. Sadly his Queen died shortly afther giving birth to the child, but she still had the time to appreciate the son of the king and loved her child to her utmost.

After a few year the City got attacked and the Castle was broken into. The son of the king got kidnapped. The kidnappers took a long journey to hide the son and most likely get rid of him. There was a great storm one night and the party got attacked whilst passing the border of a neighbouring kingdom. Messages reached the city that all had died, and with a king without a heir, the insurgents soon gained power and the royal line was by all thought a thing of the past.

`<name:hero>` woke up finding himself in a forest not knowing his past but having a pendant that he had some vague memory of. In search for a town and place to sleep he encountered a wild boar a ferocious beast, trying to fend it off he fell and hit his head. Just before fainting he saw an old monk vending off the boar.

When `<name:hero>` woke up again not knowing what happened, he found himself in an abby. He got brought up by the monks in the `<name:abby1>` Abby. There `<name:hero>` leared meanings of life... etc and at a certain age the old monk which had saved him from the boar came up to him and gave him his pendant. The monk didn't know much of the pendant, `<name:hero>` 'Now a man' had a glimpse of his mother and asked more about the pendant. Sadly the monk didn't know.

There is a village close to the abby where the monks brought some of their harvests to help those in need. There were rumours in the village of an upcoming attack, since other near by villages got attacked by the City of `<name:city1>`. `<name:hero>` went to bring some fruit to the village. There were knights in the village where he had only heard from. Great horses with barding as dark as the night and knights with magnificent dark scale armor and a lance as sharp as a needle. At that moment one of friends of `<name:hero>` got attacked for being in the way. The poor fellow got pushed over whilst he only wanted too greet `<name:hero>`, just afther tending to his daughter.
`<name:hero>` got furious and spoke of the unheard of behavior the knights where imposing.

One knight came up to him and challenged `<name:hero>` to a bare handed fight. _(Kan ook anders alley, plein, rover etc)_ `<name:hero>` won with relative ease. _(hier gaat de Speler voor het eerst zelf vechten.  lopen leert hij als hij naar het dorp moet)_ .... `<name:hero>` is then attacked by the other knights with gaunlets and loses his pendant (op een bepaalde manier ik denk dat het een leuke intro quest is als hij eerst zijn pendant terug moet zien te halen. Maar ik denk dat ik dan de knights te stoer heb beschreven en dat het misschien lage rang soldaten moeten worden).
